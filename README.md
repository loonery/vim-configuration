This repository houses a set of vim configuration settings that I use to make Vim feel a bit more friendly. The settings are commented and can be reconfigured as needed. The colorscheme is called "everforest" : https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest. 

INSTALLATION -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) clone this repository to your home directory

3) The cloned directory "vim_configuration" should be renamed to ".vim" and stored in your HOME ~ directory.
4) Open .vimrc in vim and while in Normal mode type ":PlugInstall" to the vim command line to install plugins (NerdTree and ALE).
